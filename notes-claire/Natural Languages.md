Agglutinative languages build up endings from a series of atomic pieces. Polysynthetic languages join multiples parts of speech into a single word, typically incorporating nouns into their very complex verbs

## Finite-State Morphology

- morphology -> domain of linguistics that studies the formation of words
- *surface* forms and their analyses, called *lemmas*
1. Morphotactics
	- morphemes -> smaller units of meaning
	- most languages build words by concatenation but some languages also exhibit non-concatenative processes such as interdigitation and reduplication
2. Morphological Alternations
	- shape of a morpheme depends on the environment
	- `piti` vs. `pity` in the context of `piti-less-ness` and the word alone

finite-state approach to morphology is the relation between the surface forms of a language and their corresponding lemmas can be described can be modeled as a *regular relation*
- if **regular**, can use metalang of regular expressions
	- with compiler -> code can be compiled into a finite-state transducer
